sensor -- Camera
================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The ``sensor`` module controls the camera and captures frames. It mirrors the OpenMV ``sensor`` API so existing OpenMV scripts port with little change.

Camera Initialization and Continuous Capture
--------------------------------------------

A typical program resets the sensor, selects a pixel format and frame size, lets automatic exposure and white balance settle, and then captures frames continuously:

.. code-block:: python

   import sensor

   sensor.reset()
   sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)
   sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)
   sensor.skip_frames(time=2000)

   while True:
       img = sensor.snapshot()

``sensor.reset()`` applies the board's default camera configuration. ``RGB565`` is suitable for display, drawing, and most AI workflows, while ``GRAYSCALE`` reduces memory and processing cost for many detection algorithms. ``sensor.snapshot()`` returns an :py:class:`image.Image` backed by the reusable frame buffer, so copy the image when it must remain unchanged after the next capture.

Image Orientation and Camera Status
-----------------------------------

Use horizontal mirror and vertical flip to correct the image orientation imposed by the physical sensor installation. ``status()`` provides the active dimensions, pixel format, sensor ID, orientation, and crop information for diagnostics:

.. code-block:: python

   import sensor

   sensor.reset()
   sensor.set_hmirror(True)
   sensor.set_vflip(False)

   info = sensor.status()
   print("sensor id:", info["id"])
   print("output:", info["width"], "x", info["height"])
   print("ready:", info["ready"])

Mirror and flip settings affect subsequently captured frames. Product code can call ``status()`` after initialization to verify that the camera is ready and that the negotiated output size matches the processing pipeline.

Temporarily Stop Capture
------------------------

The camera stream can be stopped when capture is not required and restarted before the next frame:

.. code-block:: python

   sensor.shutdown(True)
   # Perform work that does not require the camera.
   sensor.shutdown(False)
   sensor.skip_frames(n=3)
   img = sensor.snapshot()

After restarting the stream, discard a few frames if exposure or the incoming frame queue needs to stabilize.

IPA Runtime Control
-------------------

IPA and ISP control methods are optional firmware features. Check ``hasattr(sensor, "get_ipa")`` or ``hasattr(sensor, "get_isp")`` before using them; these methods are absent when the feature is not built in.

Use ``sensor.set_ipa(False)`` to stop the image processing algorithm (IPA) controller and ``sensor.set_ipa(True)`` to start it again. Initialize the camera before using these methods. ``sensor.get_ipa()`` returns the controller's current state, or ``None`` when runtime control is unsupported. Setting IPA on an unsupported camera raises ``OSError``.

.. code-block:: python

   sensor.reset()
   sensor.skip_frames(time=2000)
   if hasattr(sensor, "get_ipa") and sensor.get_ipa() is not None:
       sensor.set_ipa(False)
       print("IPA:", sensor.get_ipa())
       img = sensor.snapshot()
       img.flush()
       sensor.set_ipa(True)

Changing IPA state briefly stops and restarts capture while preserving the output format, frame size, mirror, and flip settings. Setting the current state again has no effect. ``sensor.reset()`` and restarting after ``sensor.shutdown(True)`` restore the default IPA state.

A failed switch leaves the camera shut down rather than in its previous state: the capture buffers, the scaler, and the camera device itself are all released before ``OSError`` is raised. Call ``sensor.reset()`` to bring the camera back.

Disabling IPA stops its automatic parameter updates; it does not bypass the ISP or clear existing tuning. The image may initially look unchanged. To compare the effect, change the illumination or light source color while previewing, then enable IPA and allow its algorithms to settle again. The algorithms controlled by this switch depend on the active IPA configuration.

Manual ISP Control
------------------

After initialization, ``sensor.get_isp(block)`` returns a dictionary of the current driver parameters, or ``None`` when the block is unsupported. A block is unsupported when the camera driver has no getter for it or when the firmware was built for a chip revision that lacks the hardware: ``lsc`` needs ESP32-P4 v1.0 or newer and ``blc`` needs v3.0 or newer, while ``exposure`` is write-only on sensors such as SC2336, so ``sensor.get_isp("exposure")`` normally returns ``None``. Call ``sensor.set_ipa(False)`` before writing manual settings. ``sensor.set_isp(block, **params)`` updates one block, keeping unspecified fields from its current configuration. Writes while IPA is running raise ``OSError`` to prevent the algorithms from overwriting manual settings.

.. code-block:: python

   sensor.reset()
   sensor.skip_frames(time=2000)
   sensor.set_ipa(False)

   print(sensor.get_isp("wb"))
   sensor.set_isp("wb", enable=False)
   sensor.set_isp("ccm", enable=False)
   sensor.set_isp("gamma", enable=False)
   sensor.snapshot().flush()

   sensor.set_isp("wb", enable=True, rg=1.8, bg=1.4)
   sensor.set_isp("exposure", value=10000)  # Microseconds, rounded to 100 us.
   sensor.set_isp("pixel_gain", value=2.0)  # Gain multiplier.

   sensor.set_ipa(True)

The supported block names and fields follow the tuning parameter vocabulary:

.. list-table:: ISP parameters
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 18 82

   * - Block
     - Fields
   * - ``exposure``
     - ``value``: exposure in microseconds, positive. The device control counts 100-microsecond units, so a write is rounded to the nearest 100 microseconds and must then fit the range and step the sensor reports, which is where the usable limits come from. SC2336 at 1280x720 30fps, for example, accepts roughly 200 microseconds through 33.2 milliseconds in 100-microsecond steps.
   * - ``pixel_gain``
     - ``value``: positive gain multiplier, selected from the nearest supported gain menu entry within the sensor's range.
   * - ``demosaic``
     - ``enable``, ``gradient_ratio``: nonnegative gradient ratio within the driver's fixed-point range.
   * - ``wb``
     - ``enable``, ``rg``, ``bg``: red and blue gain multipliers, 0 through 1023/256.
   * - ``lsc``
     - ``enable``, ``lsc_gain_size``, ``gain_r``, ``gain_gr``, ``gain_gb``, ``gain_b``: four gain lists, each with the length returned by ``get_isp("lsc")``; values are 0 through 1023/256. The size is determined by capture dimensions.
   * - ``blc``
     - ``enable``, ``stretch_enable``, ``top_left_offset``, ``top_right_offset``, ``bottom_left_offset``, ``bottom_right_offset``: black level offsets, integers from 0 through 255.
   * - ``bf``
     - ``enable``, ``level`` (2–20), ``matrix``: nine integers from 0 through 15 in row order.
   * - ``sharpen``
     - ``enable``, ``h_thresh``, ``l_thresh`` (0–255, low ≤ high), ``h_coeff``, ``m_coeff`` (0 through 255/32), ``matrix``: nine integers from 0 through 31 in row order.
   * - ``ccm``
     - ``enable``, ``matrix``: nine finite numbers strictly between -4 and 4 in row order.
   * - ``gamma``
     - ``enable``, ``x``, ``y``: two lists of 16 integers from 0 through 255. X must increase from an implicit zero by powers of two; the last point must be 255 and is treated as 256 for the final interval.

Set ``enable=True`` when applying new parameters to a disabled block. Passing only ``enable=False`` disables processing without replacing its stored tables. White balance gains are kept across that disable and come back when the block is enabled again. Gamma readback reports the red channel; setting ``x`` or ``y`` applies the resulting curve to all three channels, while an enable-only update preserves the separate channel curves. LSC tables are copied into camera-owned storage and remain valid across garbage collection and IPA switches; the camera keeps the previously installed table intact until the driver accepts the new one, so a rejected write leaves the image unchanged. Fixed-point values and sensor settings may be quantized by the driver.

Unknown blocks, invalid values, and array length mismatches are rejected before applying the update. An unsupported write raises ``OSError``. A device error may leave a partially applied configuration; use ``sensor.reset()`` to reinitialize after such a failure.

The ``example/01-Camera/04-IPA/isp_preview.py`` example configures the output format, disables IPA, then continuously previews while randomizing exposure, gain, white balance gains, and CCM every 2 seconds until Ctrl-C. Each update prints the requested exposure and the driver readback for gain, white balance gains, and CCM. Adjust ``UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS`` and the parameter range constants to change the experiment; a value the active sensor rejects is printed and skipped rather than stopping the preview. Ctrl-C leaves IPA disabled and preserves the last settings.
